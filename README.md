# VOICE CONTROL BOT
These are the codes and procedures to make a voice control bot, and voice command is given to the phone communicated via Bluetooth module to the bot.
The bot also contains three Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04), which works as an obstacle detector and stops the bot when finding any obstacle or wall within range of 6cm, and the piezo buzzer starts playing a friendly tone for which I have used an already written note of that tone.
